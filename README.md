More Californians are leaving the state than migrating into the state. 

Following these data points, we set out to prove this statement:

* increased poverty levels
* increased population 
* Transportation/traffic congestion (time to/from work)
* unemployment rates
* reduced incomes (per capita income levels)
* higher income inequality
* higher housing costs 
* higher taxes 

Population Scope Baseline: California

Population Competitive View: Colorado, Florida, Idaho, Oregon, Texas

5 states chosen based on migration data and supporting articles of top states Californians moving to
Time Frame: 5 year time frame 2013-2018
